  <h3 align="center">UNOFFICIAL UWO Timetable API</h3>
  <p align="center">
    Simple API to access data from the <a href="https://studentservices.uwo.ca/secure/timetables/mastertt/ttindex.cfm"><strong>Western Undergraduate Timetable. </strong></a>
    <br />
    The goal of this API is to give programmers a data interface to create software that that leverage UWO timetable information. For example, a custom timetable generator.

<!-- ABOUT THE PROJECT -->
## About The Project

[![Product Name Screen Shot][product-screenshot]](http://uwottapi.ca)

Currently, there exists no official timetable API and no unofficial options. To gather data from <a href="https://studentservices.uwo.ca/secure/timetables/mastertt/ttindex.cfm"><strong>Western Undergraduate Timetable, </strong></a>
each programmer must scrape the website themselves. This is not only tedious but challenging cause the website will start blocking requests if a single IP is overloading it. In my experiements, if a series of requests are made with less than a 10 second buffer between each, they will start getting blocked.

To overcome this issue, this API is designed with a built-in scraper. Every day, the scraper populates a database while waiting in between each request to ensure none is blocked. The API then provides a simple interface to query data from the database.

This API supports the following:
* Pagination
* Sorting
* Filtering
* Rate Limiting

### Built With

* [golang 1.14](https://golang.org/)
* [gin](https://github.com/gin-gonic/gin)
* [MongoDB](https://www.mongodb.com/)



<!-- GETTING STARTED -->
## Getting Started

To get a local copy up and running follow these simple steps.

### Prerequisites

By using [Docker](https://www.docker.com/), local development can start very easily. The only requirements are:

* docker
* docker-compose

### Installation - Docker Compose
 
1. Clone the repository
```sh
git clone https://github.com/cbaron3/uwo-tt-api.git
```
2. Compose the docker images
```sh
docker-compose up --build
```

docker-compose spins up two images: an image for the API on port 8080 and a MongoDB image


<!-- USAGE EXAMPLES -->
## Usage

For full API documentation, refer to [Documentation](http://uwottapi.ca/doc/index.html)

For usage examples, refer to [Examples](assets/EXAMPLES.md)

Usage is currently limited to <strong>120 requests per hour</strong> due to server limitations. This limit can be modified if the project warrants purchasing strong a better server.

<!-- ROADMAP -->
## Roadmap
